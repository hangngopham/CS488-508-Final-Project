CS488/508 Data Mining Final Project Files
##########################################

Progress:
    Finished Step 1
    Finished Step 2, final files are in the step2_result_files folder
    Started Step 3, added stats for step 3.b in step3 folder

Notes:
    The normalized train file generated via normalize.py from step 1,
    is used with the python code and scripts found in step2. 
    In this project's current form, the generated files from step 1 must be
    manually moved over to the step 2 folder (e.g. use mv). Additionally, the final csv files
    generated from step2 must be manually converted to arff using weka.
    This has already been done and the results have been placed into the 
    step2_result_files folder, however recreation of the files should keep these
    notes in mind.

    Based on the data calculated for step3.b, the best gene set is N=15 w/ model IBk where K = 4.
    No optimizations were made to the model (may want to work with this).
